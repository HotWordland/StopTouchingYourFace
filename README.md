# StopTouchingYourFace
SwiftUI App that alerts you when you have touched your face.
This happens to be an App version of my submission for the [WWDC20 Swift Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/) 

## How does it work?

Well it uses a small (not great) CoreML Classification Model I created using Microsoft's [Custom Vision](https://www.customvision.ai). That classifies wether or not someone in the picture is touching their face.

Sine my model isn't amazing, I make sure that there's actually a face in the image with Visions [VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vision/vndetectfacerectanglesrequest).

And the rest is just pretty SwiftUI code üòç
